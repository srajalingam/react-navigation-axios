Router latest version need to install this one
   -> npm install react-router-dom

    <Route exact path="/" component={Home}/>
    ->exact is used to load particular comp otherwise all will list in the same page does act as subset behavior.

<a> tag will reload the page so we can usebelow
    import {Link,NavLink} from "react-router-dom"; -> prevent the page reload
     <li><Link to="/">Home</Link></li>
        ->Link there is no active class added when u inspect

        ->NavLink active class added


npm install axios -> used to make the request
